          We are seeking members
        </h1>
        <p>Nakuja project is a student-driven project. 
          Most of the students come from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture And Technology (JKUAT).
          There are also students from other universities, such as Kenyatta University and Dedan Kimathi University of Technology.
        </p>

          Internship
        </h1>
        <p>
          The best way to catch up with the team is to join the internship program. 
          In 2024, we will offer the internship for 12 weeks from January to April. 
          We will offer another batch from September to December 2024 for the same 12 weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The internship program is open to all students in Kenya, but we need commitment for the whole period. 
          This is not suitable for the students who intend just to fulfill the requirements for their curriculum. 
          It is an intensive program, and the participants will learn a lot from interacting with the other participants.          
        </p>
        <p>
          The students are also expected to learn by themselves actively. 
          The participants are recommended to have the following practical skills as much as possible before joining the program.
        </p>
        <div class="content">
        <ul>
          <li>Mechanical design, 3D CAD (SolidWorks), ANSYS (FEM and CFD)</li>
          <li>Manual machining (lathe, drilling), CNC machining, Welding, 3D printing</li>
          <li>Circuit design, Embedded programming (Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi), Oscilloscope</li>
          <li>Antenna design, Vector network analyzer, Web programming</li>
          <li>C/C++, Python, MATLAB, FreeRTOS, Linux</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For those who don't have sufficient knowledge and skills yet, it is recommended to apply after you have learned the basics.
